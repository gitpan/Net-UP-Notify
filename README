Net::UP::Notify version 0.01
======================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

This allows you to send a Net Alert to a cellular phone, provided you
know the subscriber ID of the user.
This also requires the end user to have the Wireless Web service on
their phone, and they also must have it provisioned by the carrier.
                                                                                
This was designed and tested using a Nextel phone, but I think that
both Cingular and Sprint PCS should be supported here when given the
proper subscriberid string.
                                                                                
My intention is to completely support the entire UP SDK, but for right
now, I can only support the sending of Net Alerts.
